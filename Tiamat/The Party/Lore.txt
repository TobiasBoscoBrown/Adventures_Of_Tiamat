The Party Lore

The party essentially wakes up all in Cardious. They won't know how they
got there, only that they were in their hometown moments before. They
all have gained return from death because Time is still fighting against
Tiamat, and chose them to rebirth Tiamat so that the world can continue
to live, so that they may destroy her and bring back life. Happens every
thousand years. The world begins to get sick, Tiamat is ressurected to
bring life back to the world, and Tiamat is then destroyed to preserve
the world.
