### **Introduction: The Lifeblood of Tiamat**

Deep within the mountains, in what we Dwarves know as the very kidneys of Tiamat, lie the KneeStone Mines. These mines aren't just any old holes in the ground—they're the veins that pump out the lifeblood of wealth, the very essence that keeps our people thriving. For thousands of years, we've dug deep, pulled up riches untold, and faced down horrors that would make lesser folk turn tail and run. But not us. We're Dwarves, and this is our legacy.

### **481 A.T.: The Founding of the KneeStone Mines**

Back in **481 A.T.**, our forefathers struck gold—quite literally—when they found the KneeStone Mines. Led by the legendary Thror Stonehammer, these Dwarves weren't looking for an easy life. No, they wanted the kind of wealth that only comes from the bones of the earth itself. And they found it. Gold, silver, mithril—it was all there, just waiting to be pulled out of the ground. The KneeStone Mines became our people's greatest treasure, a source of pride and prosperity.

But make no mistake, the mines weren’t just a gift. They were a challenge. From day one, there were things down there—things that didn’t belong in our world. Strange noises, shifting shadows, and the ever-present feeling that something was watching from the dark. But did that stop us? Not a chance. We kept digging, and we kept fighting, because that's what we do.

### **600-800 A.T.: The Age of Expansion**

After the initial discovery, the next few centuries were what we call the Age of Expansion. The KneeStone Mines grew deeper and wider as more Dwarves flocked to the area, eager to share in the wealth. New tunnels were carved, and the mining operations expanded to unprecedented levels. The wealth flowed like ale in a tavern, and the Dwarves established themselves as the masters of Tiamat's southern mountains, while our Northern Brothers focused their efforts on their own lands.

But with the wealth came new dangers. The deeper we dug, the more we encountered creatures from the Underdark. Early reports spoke of strange, bulbous-eyed creatures that moved silently in the shadows—Mindflayers, though we didn’t have a name for them then. We lost many good Dwarves in those early years, but we learned quickly. The mines were fortified, and the first of many great battles against the horrors of the deep began.

### **950 A.T.: Durin Knee Takes the Helm**

By **950 A.T.**, the Knee family had firmly established themselves as the rulers of the KneeStone Mines. Durin Knee, a direct descendant of Thror Stonehammer, was a Dwarf known for his iron will and unmatched skill with a pickaxe. Under his leadership, the mines flourished, and the Knee family became synonymous with wealth and power.

Durin wasn't just a leader—he was a protector. The Orcs had started to make their presence known, and Durin was determined to keep them at bay. He led his people with a combination of strength and cunning, building fortifications around the mines and training his warriors to fight with the same ferocity as the creatures that lurked in the depths.

It was also during Durin's reign that the first great treasure was unearthed—The Heart of Tiamat, a massive ruby believed to be infused with the dragon's lifeblood itself. This discovery only added to the legend of the KneeStone Mines, drawing more adventurers and traders to the area.

### **1063 A.T.: The Human Arrival and Thrain Knee’s Alliances**

When the Humans arrived on Tiamat in **1063 A.T.**, the Dwarves saw an opportunity. Thrain Knee, the grandson of Durin, was the one who struck the deal. The Humans were desperate—lost and nearly wiped out by the disasters that had driven them from their homeland. Thrain saw their plight and extended a hand, but not out of kindness—he knew the value of a good ally.

Thrain’s shrewd negotiations ensured that the Humans would rely heavily on the KneeStone Mines for the metals they needed to build their new cities and temples. The Dwarves supplied the Humans with iron and mithril, and in return, the Humans spread the word of Tiamat, bringing even more trade and wealth to the mines.

During this period, the KneeStone Mines reached their peak production. The Dwarves dug deeper than ever before, uncovering vast new veins of mithril and gold. It was said that the veins were endless, a gift from Tiamat herself to her chosen people. But the deeper we went, the more dangerous it became. The Mindflayers grew bolder, attacking in greater numbers, and we began to hear rumors of something even darker lurking below.

### **1400-1500 A.T.: The Dark Century**

The century from **1400 to 1500 A.T.** is known among Dwarves as the Dark Century. The mines had grown so vast and deep that they were almost impossible to defend completely. Creatures from the Underdark began to infiltrate more frequently. There were reports of entire mining teams disappearing, leaving nothing but their tools behind. The Mindflayers, growing more organized, launched coordinated attacks, and we found ourselves in a constant state of battle.

During this time, Balin Knee, a descendant of Thrain, took command. He was known as the Iron-Fisted, and he lived up to the name. Balin was ruthless in his defense of the mines, sealing off entire sections that were overrun and fortifying the remaining tunnels. But even he couldn’t stop the losses entirely. The KneeStone Mines’ production slowed, and for the first time, Dwarves began to whisper that perhaps the mines were cursed.

Balin knew he had to do something drastic. He commissioned the construction of the Great Gates of KneeStone, massive doors of mithril and stone that would seal off the deeper, more dangerous sections of the mines. These gates were enchanted with powerful runes, designed to keep the horrors of the Underdark at bay. It was a costly project, but it worked—at least for a time.

### **1680 A.T.: The Elven-Human War and Balin Knee’s Calculations**

By the time the Elven-Human War broke out in **1680 A.T.**, the Knee family had long since mastered the art of survival. Balin Knee, great-grandson of Thrain, was a Dwarf who understood that in times of war, the real power lay not on the battlefield, but in the mines. He supplied weapons to both sides, ensuring that the KneeStone Mines remained prosperous no matter who won.

Balin was no fool—he knew that the war would eventually come to an end, and when it did, the Knee family would still be standing. The wealth of the mines continued to flow, and Balin’s careful management kept his people safe from the chaos above. When Jarnath, the Human hero, rose to prominence, Balin made sure that the Knee family was well-positioned to profit from his victories and his defeats.

### **1770-1800 A.T.: The Great Orcish War and Thorin Knee’s Leadership**

The Great Orcish War from **1770 to 1800 A.T.** was one of the most trying times for the Knee family. Thorin Knee, descendant of Balin, was the one who led the Dwarves through the conflict. The Orcs, desperate and vengeful after their defeat by the Elves and Humans, turned their sights on the KneeStone Mines. They believed that if they could take the mines, they could regain their lost power.

Thorin wasn’t about to let that happen. He fortified the mines, rallying his warriors and leading them into battle against the Orcish hordes. The war was brutal, with the Dwarves fighting alongside the Elves and Humans to keep the Orcs at bay. In the end, the Orcs were defeated, their city of Hell was renamed Grudge, and Tiamat was unified under joint leadership.

Thorin's leadership during the war ensured that the Knee family’s control over the mines remained unchallenged. The wealth continued to flow, and the Knee family’s legacy was cemented in the annals of Dwarven history.

### **1800-1950 A.T.: The Rebuilding Period**

After the Great Orcish War, the KneeStone Mines entered what is known as the Rebuilding Period. The mines had taken a beating during the war—sections had collapsed, and production had slowed to a trickle. But the Dwarves are nothing if not resilient. Under the leadership of Thorin Knee’s son, Durin II, the mines were rebuilt and expanded once again.

This period also saw the development of new mining techniques and technologies. The Dwarves became more efficient, and the mines began to produce at levels even greater than before. But with the new depth came new dangers. The Mindflayers, once thought to have been driven back, returned in force, and there were new rumors—of ancient, dark creatures that lived in the deepest parts of the Underdark. The Dwarves fortified once again, preparing for what they feared might be a second war.

### **1950-2150 A.T.: Borin Knee Strengthens the Mines**

In **1950 A.T.**, Borin Knee, a direct descendant of Thorin Knee, took the helm of the KneeStone Mines. Borin was a Dwarf with a mind as sharp as his axe. He knew that the riches of the mines were dwindling, and that the Dwarves would need to dig deeper than ever before to find new veins of gold, silver, and mithril. But he also knew that the deeper they dug, the more dangerous it would become.

Borin made it his mission to strengthen the defenses of the mines even further. He expanded the Great Gates of KneeStone and commissioned the construction of new fortifications throughout the mines. Under his leadership, the Dwarves developed new weapons and armor, designed specifically to combat the horrors of the Underdark. The KneeStone Mines were more secure than they had ever been, but the dangers were greater than ever before.

### **2150-3000 A.T.: The Era of Prosperity**

The centuries between **2150** and **3000 A.T.** were a time of great prosperity for the KneeStone Mines. The Dwarves of the Knee family had finally found a balance between extracting the wealth of Tiamat's kidneys and protecting themselves from the dangers that lurked below. The mines produced an abundance of gold, silver, and mithril, and the Knee family’s wealth and influence grew even greater.

During this time, the KneeStone Mines became the center of trade and commerce for all of Tiamat. Dwarves from all over the continent came to work in the mines, and merchants from every corner of the world came to buy the precious metals and gems that were unearthed. The Knee family continued to lead, ensuring that the mines remained safe and productive.

It was during this period of prosperity that the relationship between the KneeStone Dwarves and their Northern Brothers, the Dwarves of the Spine of Tiamat, grew stronger. In **2467 A.T.,** the Northern Brothers founded the city of Gondor, deep in the mountains of the Spine. While the Northern Dwarves focused on creating legendary weapons and armor, the Knee family continued to extract and refine the precious resources of the KneeStone Mines. This partnership between these two Dwarven strongholds was unparalleled, leading to an era of unmatched Dwarven prosperity across the continent.

However, even in these golden years, whispers of danger persisted. It was also during this time that the first rumors of a red dragon began to surface. Miners reported seeing glimpses of a massive, serpentine creature deep within the earth. Whether it was real or just another miner’s tale, the rumors added to the mystique and danger of the KneeStone Mines. The Dwarves knew that the deeper they dug, the closer they came to the unknown, but as always, they pressed on, driven by their unyielding desire to unearth Tiamat's greatest treasures.

### **3000-4000 A.T.: The Golden Age of the KneeStone Mines**

The period between **3000** and **4000 A.T.** is known as the Golden Age of the KneeStone Mines. The mines reached their peak production, and the wealth they produced was unmatched by any other mine in Tiamat. The Knee family’s influence extended far beyond the mines, as they became key players in the politics and commerce of the entire continent.

This was also a time of great innovation. The Dwarves developed new techniques for mining and metalworking, creating even more valuable and sought-after products. The KneeStone Mines became known not just for their wealth, but for the quality of the goods they produced.

But even in this time of prosperity, there were challenges. The Mindflayers and other creatures of the Underdark continued to pose a threat, and the Dwarves were forced to constantly defend their territory. The Great Gates of KneeStone, built centuries earlier, were reinforced and expanded, creating a nearly impenetrable barrier between the mines and the horrors below.

---

### **4000-5000 A.T.: The Decline Begins**

As the KneeStone Mines entered their fifth millennium, the first signs of decline began to appear. The richest veins of gold and mithril had been exhausted, and the Dwarves were forced to dig deeper and deeper to find new sources of wealth. The dangers of the Underdark became more pronounced, with Mindflayers and other creatures launching more frequent and deadly attacks.

During this time, the Knee family faced increasing pressure to maintain their control over the mines. The wealth they had once taken for granted was becoming harder to extract, and the dangers were growing greater by the day. But the Dwarves are nothing if not stubborn, and they continued to dig, hoping to find new riches and keep the mines productive.

It was during this period that the first confirmed sightings of the red dragon were reported. Miners spoke of a massive, shimmering creature that roamed the deepest parts of the mines, guarding the greatest treasures of all. The dragon became both a symbol of the dangers of the mines and a source of hope—perhaps there were still untold riches to be found.

### **5000-5800 A.T.: The Struggle for Survival**

The centuries between **5000** and **5800 A.T.** were marked by a struggle for survival. The KneeStone Mines, once the most prosperous and well-defended mines in all of Tiamat, were now a place of constant danger and diminishing returns. The Dwarves continued to dig, but the wealth they once enjoyed was becoming harder and harder to find.

The Mindflayers, brain dogs, and other creatures of the Underdark were relentless in their attacks, and the Dwarves were forced to fight a constant battle just to keep the mines operational. The Great Gates of KneeStone, once thought to be impenetrable, were breached on several occasions, leading to devastating losses.

But even in the face of these challenges, the Knee family remained strong. They continued to lead the Dwarves with the same determination and strength that had characterized their ancestors. The mines were fortified once again, and the Dwarves fought on, refusing to give up the wealth that was their birthright.

### **5800 A.T.: Arrotoda Knee and the Modern Era**

In **5800 A.T.**, Arrotoda Knee was born into a family that had ruled the KneeStone Mines for thousands of years. He inherited the same determination and strength that had characterized his ancestors. As the current ruler of the mines, Arrotoda has continued the family tradition of wealth, power, and protection.

Arrotoda is a Dwarf of few words but great wisdom. He’s seen his share of challenges, particularly from the horrors that lurk in the Underdark. Mindflayers, brain dogs, and other abominations have tried to invade the mines, but Arrotoda, like his forebears, has stood strong. He fights not just with his hammer, but with his mind, leading his people with the same grit and determination that has defined the Knee family for generations.

---

### **5805 A.T.: The Arrival of Dis Knee**

In **5805 A.T.**, Arrotoda found his match in Dis Knee, a formidable Dwarf who was as strong-willed as he was. Dis isn’t just Arrotoda’s wife—she’s his partner in every sense of the word. Known for her incredible strength and her ability to hold her own in the mines, Dis has been a vital part of the Knee family’s continued success.

Dis Knee handles the financials of the KneeStone Mines, ensuring that the wealth continues to flow while also keeping an eye on the dangers that lurk below. She’s killed her fair share of Mindflayers and isn’t afraid to get her hands dirty when the situation calls for it. Together, Arrotoda and Dis have kept the KneeStone Mines prosperous and secure, continuing the legacy of the Knee family.

### **The Underdark and the Mines' Dangers**

The deeper we dig, the more we uncover. The Underdark, a twisted maze of tunnels and caverns, is home to horrors that would make your skin crawl—Mindflayers, brain dogs, and worse. Arrotoda Knee and Dis Knee have done everything they can to keep the mines safe, but it’s a constant battle. Whispers of a red dragon lurking in the depths have surfaced, guarding the greatest treasures of all. Whether it’s real or just another miner’s tale, we don’t know. But we’re not about to stop digging to find out.

### **Conclusion: The KneeStone Mines—Our Legacy, Our Life**

The KneeStone Mines have been the heart and soul of the Dwarven people for over 5,500 years. They’re the kidneys of Tiamat, filtering the earth’s essence into the gold, silver, and mithril that have made us who we are. The Knee family has led us through thick and thin, and they’ll keep leading us, no matter what comes crawling out of the dark.

As long as we have our mines, we have our future. We’ll keep digging, keep fighting, and keep thriving, just as we’ve always done. The KneeStone Mines are more than just a place—they’re our legacy, our life, and we’ll protect them with every ounce of strength we’ve got.
