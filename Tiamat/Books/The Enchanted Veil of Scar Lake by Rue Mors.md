## **Introduction**

In the shadowed corners of Tiamat, where the boundaries between the mundane and the magical blur, lies the mysterious Scar Lake. Nestled north of Gondor and the Aiery Planes, and southwest of Kubi, this enigmatic body of water is more than just a geographical feature—it's a scar on the very fabric of the world. Scar Lake is a place of legend, where time itself seems to unravel, and where strange, otherworldly creatures roam the land. But what is the truth behind this mysterious lake? This book seeks to explore the rumors, myths, and half-truths that surround Scar Lake, offering readers a glimpse into one of Tiamat’s most puzzling and fascinating locales.

## **Chapter 1: The Origin of Scar Lake**

The legends of Scar Lake are as old as Tiamat itself. It is said that Scar Lake marks the very spot where Tiamat, the great dragon deity, was mortally wounded. The lake, with its deep, dark waters, is believed to be the gaping wound left behind by the final blow that brought Tiamat down. This wound was inflicted by the Old Gods, powerful deities whose might could rend the very essence of existence. As Tiamat fell, the Old Gods struck a final blow, leaving behind a scar that would forever mar the surface of Tiamat.

Some believe that the lake’s waters are cursed, tainted by the blood of Tiamat and the residual magic of the Old Gods. The very ground around the lake is said to be warped by the immense power of the blow, creating a veil between the physical world and the Fey. This veil is thin, allowing the strange and the mystical to seep through, making Scar Lake a place where reality itself can be questioned.

## **Chapter 2: The Temporal Oddities**

One of the most persistent rumors surrounding Scar Lake is the bizarre temporal effects experienced by those who venture too close. Time, it seems, does not flow normally in the vicinity of the lake. Travelers have reported losing hours, days, or even years after spending mere moments near its shores. Some have aged decades in what felt like a single night, while others have returned unchanged after what they perceived to be months or even years.

These temporal anomalies have led to the belief that Scar Lake is a place where time is fractured, where past, present, and future bleed into one another. The Old Gods’ final blow, it is said, did more than just wound Tiamat—it tore a hole in the very fabric of time, creating a place where the usual rules of reality no longer apply.

There are stories of travelers encountering themselves in the forested areas around the lake—older or younger versions, ghosts of the past or specters of the future. Some claim to have seen entire civilizations rise and fall in the blink of an eye, as if the lake is a window into alternate realities or distant epochs. Whether these tales are true or merely the result of the lake’s unsettling aura is up for debate, but the consistency of these reports suggests that something very unusual is at work.

## **Chapter 3: The Feylike Creatures of Scar Lake**

The veil that separates the mundane world from the realm of the Fey is said to be thin around Scar Lake. As a result, the area is home to creatures that defy explanation—beings of otherworldly beauty and terror, whose motives are as inscrutable as their forms. The Fey of Scar Lake are not the whimsical, playful creatures of children’s tales; they are ancient, powerful, and often dangerous.

Among the most awe-inspiring and terrifying of these creatures is the Dragon, a majestic being with scales that shimmer in hues of light blue and teal, as if reflecting the very essence of time itself. Its eyes, ancient and wise, glow with an ethereal light that seems to see through the very fabric of reality. The dragon moves with a grace and fluidity that defies logic, its presence both enchanting and menacing. Those who have glimpsed the Dragon speak of a creature of immense power, one that guards the lake and its secrets with an unyielding ferocity.

There are reports of travelers encountering these Feylike beings, only to be entranced by their beauty or driven mad by their incomprehensible nature. Some describe creatures with the graceful form of elves but with eyes that shimmer like stars, their voices like the chiming of a thousand bells. Others speak of beings that shift and change shape with every heartbeat, their forms fluid and impossible to define.

These creatures are often associated with the lake’s strange temporal effects. Some say that they are guardians of the time-rift, protecting the lake from those who would seek to exploit its power. Others believe that the Fey are prisoners of the lake, trapped between worlds by the very magic that created Scar Lake. Whatever the truth, one thing is certain—encounters with these beings rarely end well for the unprepared.

## **Chapter 4: The Shimmering Time Crystals**

Deep within the waters of Scar Lake, beneath layers of silt and sediment, lie the fabled Time Crystals. These crystals are said to be fragments of the Old Gods' power, shattered when they struck Tiamat’s flesh. The crystals are rumored to be impossibly beautiful, glowing with a light that shifts and changes in response to the flow of time around them.

Those who have managed to retrieve these crystals (and lived to tell the tale) speak of their incredible power. It is said that the crystals can manipulate time itself—slowing it down, speeding it up, or even stopping it altogether. However, the crystals are as dangerous as they are powerful. Their use often comes with a heavy price, warping the user’s perception of time or causing them to become unstuck in time, lost forever in the endless currents of past and future.

The shimmering light they emit can sometimes be seen from the shore, flickering like a distant star just beneath the surface of the water.

## **Chapter 5: The Truth of Scar Lake?**

For all the rumors and legends that surround Scar Lake, the truth remains elusive. Some elements of the stories are undoubtedly based in fact—the strange temporal effects, the dangerous creatures, and the existence of the Time Crystals. However, the full story of Scar Lake, and the true nature of the events that created it, may never be known.

Scar Lake is a place where magic and reality intertwine, where the veil between worlds is thin, and where the past, present, and future collide. It is a place of beauty and danger, where time itself seems to unravel. Whether Scar Lake is a wound in the fabric of the world, a gateway to the Fey, or simply a place where ancient magics linger, one thing is certain—it is a place that should be approached with caution and respect.

Perhaps, in time, the full truth of Scar Lake will be revealed. Until then, it remains one of Tiamat’s greatest mysteries, a place where anything is possible and where the rules of reality no longer apply.
