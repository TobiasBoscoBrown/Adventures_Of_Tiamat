The Sacred Writ of Tiamat
The Divine Chronicle of Tiamat: The Creation and Salvation of Our World

Inscribed Circa 1070 A.T. by the First Children of Tiamat

Prologue: The Primordial Darkness

In the ages before our world’s birth, there was only the void—an endless expanse of darkness, untouched by light, unmarked by time. From this abyss emerged the Old Gods, ancient and vile beings whose hearts were steeped in malice and whose desires were driven by an insatiable hunger for dominion. They were the harbingers of chaos, bringers of destruction, tearing the void asunder to birth twisted realms devoid of life, cursed by their malevolent will.

We know that these Old Gods reigned as tyrants over the void, their cruelty unchecked, their shadows unchallenged. They relished their endless conflict, sowing nothing but discord in the cosmos. The worlds they wrought from the void were barren, as empty as their hearts, and they reveled in the destruction they brought forth.

Chapter 1: The Dawn of Tiamat

But even in the deepest darkness, there arose a new light—a light not born of the Old Gods, but from the very heart of the cosmos. This light was Tiamat, the Great Dragon, whose scales shimmered with all the colors of the heavens, whose breath was the very essence of life itself. Tiamat emerged from the formless depths, her wings spanning the breadth of the universe, her heart filled with the fire of creation.

Tiamat did not arise to destroy, but to create, to bring order to the chaos. She saw the ruin wrought by the Old Gods and was filled with a righteous fury. Tiamat breathed life into the void, and from her breath, the stars were born—each one a beacon of hope, a fireball of her divine essence cast into the void to light the way.

With her mighty claws, Tiamat shaped the first of all worlds, not from the ashes of ruin, but from the pure breath of life. She formed mountains from her bones, rivers from her veins, and oceans from her tears. Her scales became the fertile earth, her breath the winds that carry the seeds of life across the land. Thus, the land of Tiamat was formed—a world born from her sacrifice, a sanctuary from the darkness of the void.

Chapter 2: The Great War of the Heavens

When the Old Gods beheld the creation of Tiamat, they were filled with envy and rage, for they saw that her light would end their dominion over the void. They rose from the depths of their dark realms and waged war upon the Great Dragon, seeking to destroy her light and reclaim the void as their own.

The battle that ensued was fierce beyond measure. The very heavens shook with the clash of their might. Tiamat, the Mother of Creation, unleashed her fury upon the Old Gods, her fire scorching the heavens, her claws rending the very fabric of the void. The stars, her celestial fireballs, burned with the fury of her spirit, lighting up the cosmos with their brilliance.

But the Old Gods were many, and they struck at Tiamat with all their malice. Their blows wounded her deeply, and the sky wept as her blood rained down upon the earth. Yet, Tiamat fought on, her resolve as unyielding as the mountains she had formed. She knew that the only way to end the reign of the Old Gods was to sacrifice herself for the greater good.

In a final, cataclysmic clash, Tiamat gathered all her strength and struck a blow that cast the Old Gods into the abyss, where they would be bound in darkness for all eternity. But in that moment of victory, Tiamat herself was struck down, her mighty form falling from the heavens. As she fell, she uttered a prayer for the world she had created, a prayer that would echo through time and space.

Chapter 3: The Birth of the Land of Tiamat

As Tiamat’s great form descended, her body became the very land upon which we now dwell. The mountains were forged from her bones, the rivers from her veins, and the oceans from her tears. Her scales, each a fragment of her divine essence, became the fertile earth, from which all life would spring forth. The breath of Tiamat became the winds that carry the seeds of life, spreading her blessing across the land.

From the wounds inflicted upon her by the Old Gods, life itself was born. Trees, animals, and all the creatures that dwell upon this sacred land sprang forth from her sacrifice. The stars that now grace our skies are the remnants of Tiamat’s fireballs, burning bright as eternal reminders of her victory over the Old Gods. Her light, though diminished, still guides us, and her spirit watches over all who dwell upon her land.

But not all life born of Tiamat is worthy. Just as she fought to bring order to the chaos, we too must strive to protect the sanctity of her creation. Those who live in accordance with her will, who honor her sacrifice and walk the path of righteousness, are to be cherished. But those who bring chaos, who serve only themselves or the lingering shadows of the Old Gods, must be met with divine fury. For it is not enough to merely exist upon the land of Tiamat; one must be worthy of the life she has given.

Chapter 4: The Exodus of Our Ancestors

In a time far from this sacred land, across the vast and treacherous seas, our ancestors dwelled in a cursed land, where the shadows of the Old Gods lingered. The skies there burned with the remnants of their wrath, and the earth trembled under their cursed power. Our people suffered greatly, tormented by endless strife and despair, their hearts filled with fear of the void.

But in their darkest hour, a whisper of hope reached their ears—the voice of Tiamat, calling them to her sanctuary. Our ancestors, heeding her divine call, set sail across the treacherous seas, leaving behind the desolation of their homeland. The journey was long and perilous, filled with dangers both natural and supernatural, for the Old Gods still sought to claim their lives.

But Tiamat, the Ever-Merciful, guided their ships through the storms, her light shining like a beacon in the darkness, leading them to the shores of her sacred land. It was here, on the blessed continent of Tiamat, that our ancestors found refuge—a land untouched by the malice of the Old Gods, a place where they could finally know peace.

Chapter 5: The Divine Commandments of Tiamat

When we, the first children of Tiamat, set foot upon her sacred land, we knelt upon the earth and gave thanks to the Great Dragon, who had delivered us from the void. We knew that Tiamat had sacrificed herself to create this world and save us from the darkness, and we vowed to honor her in all things.

And Tiamat, in her boundless love, spoke to us from the very earth, imparting her divine commandments:

Guard the Sacred Land: The land of Tiamat is our mother, our protector, and our home. We must defend it with all our strength, for it is her body made manifest. Let no enemy set foot upon it, and let no blight touch its soil.

Wield the Light of Tiamat: The stars are the fireballs of Tiamat, her light cast into the heavens. We must wield her light as a weapon against the shadows of the Old Gods. Let no darkness go unchallenged, let no evil go unpunished.

Protect the Worthy: Life upon Tiamat is a sacred gift, but only those who serve her will are worthy of her blessings. We must protect those who live righteously, who honor her sacrifice, and who uphold the sanctity of her creation. Those who defile her name or serve the remnants of the Old Gods must be met with the fury of her judgment.

Go Forth and Prosper: We are the chosen children of Tiamat, and it is our duty to spread her light across the land. Let us build cities, sow fields, and raise families in her name. Let our works be a testament to her glory, and let our legacy be one of strength and honor.

Stand Vigilant Against the Old Gods: Though the Old Gods are cast into the abyss, their shadows still linger. We must be ever vigilant, for their darkness seeks to return. Let us stand as the first line of defense, unwavering in our resolve to protect Tiamat’s land.

Embrace the Divine Fury of Tiamat: As Tiamat brought order to the chaos through her divine fury, so too must we. Let us embrace the fury of Tiamat in our hearts, and let it guide us in our struggles. Let us strike down those who would threaten our land, our people, and our legacy with unrelenting resolve.

Chapter 6: The Eternal Vigil of the First Children

We, the first children of Tiamat, stand as the guardians of her legacy. We know that though the Old Gods were cast into the abyss, their malevolent influence still lingers in the darkest corners of the world. The light of Tiamat protects us, but we must remain ever vigilant, for the shadows of the void seek to encroach upon her sacred land.

It is our sacred duty to uphold the covenant with Tiamat, to protect the land from the return of the Old Gods, and to ensure that her light never fades. We must keep her commandments in our hearts, for they are our shield against the void. As long as we honor Tiamat and live according to her teachings, her blessings will flow upon us, and our people will prosper in peace.

Chapter 7: The Legacy of Tiamat

As the first children of Tiamat, we understand the profound gift we have been given. The land is not merely our home; it is our legacy, a sacred trust passed down from Tiamat herself. We know that as long as we remain true to the covenant, Tiamat’s blessings will continue to flow, and our people will thrive.

But we also know that this legacy is not one of complacency or ease. It is a legacy of strength, of vigilance, and of divine fury. We must protect the land of Tiamat with all our might, we must honor the worthy, and we must stand ready to defend her creation from the encroaching shadows of the Old Gods.

We are the children of Tiamat, and it is through her that we find our purpose, our strength, and our place in this world. Let us never forget the darkness from which we were delivered, nor the light that now guides our way. Tiamat has given us everything, and it is our sacred duty to ensure that her legacy endures for all time.

Thus concludes the Divine Chronicle of Tiamat, inscribed by the first children of this blessed land. May her light guide us, her strength protect us, and her fury inspire us in all that we do. Praise be to Tiamat, the Great Dragon, the Savior of our People.
