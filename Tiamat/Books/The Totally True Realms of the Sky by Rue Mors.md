These are the Sky Islands, and I, Rue Mors, bring you the **truth** about these mysterious lands.

### **Chapter 1: The True Origins of the Sky Islands**

The Sky Islands are not some whimsical creation of legend—they are remnants of Tiamat’s own body, raised into the heavens during the final, cataclysmic battle between Tiamat and the Old Gods. When Tiamat, in her divine wrath, fought the Old Gods, her mighty form was torn asunder, and fragments of her body were cast into the sky. These fragments, imbued with her power, became the Sky Islands—floating lands that defy gravity itself.

It is said that Tiamat, in her dying moments, infused these islands with her essence, ensuring that they would remain aloft for all eternity. The Sky Islands are thus sacred ground, pieces of the very goddess who gave life to our world. Those who dare to venture there are not just explorers, but pilgrims seeking the divine.

This truth has been kept hidden by those who fear the power these islands hold. But no more! The Sky Islands are real, and their origins are as divine as the stars themselves.

### **Chapter 2: The Creatures of the Sky Islands**

The Sky Islands are home to creatures unlike any found on the earth below. The most majestic of these are the Aarakocra, a race of bird-like people who soar through the skies with unparalleled grace. The Aarakocra are not mere legends—they are a proud and noble race, their feathers shimmering with the colors of the dawn and dusk, their eyes as sharp as the mountain winds.

These Aarakocra live in cities built of cloudstone, a material lighter than air yet stronger than steel. Their homes are perched on the edges of the islands, where they can look down upon the world and watch for intruders. The Aarakocra are the true rulers of the skies, and they guard their domain fiercely.

But the Aarakocra are not alone. The Sky Islands are also home to the legendary Sky Serpents—enormous winged serpents that glide through the air, their scales glittering like silver. These serpents are as dangerous as they are beautiful, with venom that can paralyze even the strongest of warriors. The Aarakocra speak of these serpents with reverence, for they believe the Sky Serpents were created by Tiamat herself to guard the islands from those who would defile them.

And then there are the Cloud Giants, towering beings who dwell in castles of mist and ice. These giants are the ancient custodians of the Sky Islands, their purpose known only to them. They are said to be as old as the islands themselves, their power unmatched by any other creature in the skies.

These creatures are not the stuff of fairy tales—they are real, and they live among the clouds, waiting for those brave enough to seek them out.

### **Chapter 3: The Inhabitants of the Sky Islands**

While the Aarakocra are the most well-known inhabitants of the Sky Islands, they are not the only ones. There are also hidden tribes of Humans, Elves, and other races who have made the islands their home. These sky-dwellers are a secretive people, rarely seen by those on the ground, but they exist, and their presence has been confirmed by those who have ventured into the skies.

Among these tribes are the Cloud Walkers, a group of Humans who have learned to harness the winds themselves. These people can walk on air as easily as we walk on solid ground, and they have built entire cities suspended in the sky. The Cloud Walkers are said to possess ancient knowledge, passed down through generations, that allows them to control the very elements.

And then there is the Sky King, the mysterious ruler of the Sky Islands. The Sky King is a being of immense power, capable of controlling the winds and commanding the creatures of the sky. His throne is said to be made of solidified air, and his crown is a ring of lightning that crackles with energy. The Sky King’s true identity is a closely guarded secret, but he is believed to be a descendant of the first Aarakocra, imbued with the power of Tiamat herself.

These inhabitants are real, and they live in a world beyond our reach, watching over the earth from their lofty perches.

### **Chapter 4: The Treasures of the Sky Islands**

The treasures of the Sky Islands are not mere myths—they are real, and they are waiting to be claimed by those brave enough to seek them out. The most sought-after of these treasures are the Sky Pearls, said to be formed from the tears of the stars themselves. These pearls hold immense power, capable of granting the bearer the ability to control the winds, summon storms, or even float above the ground like the islands themselves.

But the Sky Pearls are not the only treasures hidden in the clouds. There are also ancient temples, built by the first inhabitants of the islands, filled with golden idols, jeweled relics, and scrolls of lost knowledge. These temples are protected by powerful enchantments and deadly traps, but for those who can overcome these obstacles, the rewards are beyond imagination.

One of the most legendary treasures is the Windstone, a crystal said to contain the very essence of the sky. The Windstone can grant its bearer the power to control the weather, summoning storms, calming winds, and even parting the clouds to reveal the islands hidden within. This treasure is said to be guarded by the Sky King himself, who will only grant it to those he deems worthy.

These treasures are real, and they are waiting for those with the courage to claim them.

### **Chapter 5: The Mysteries of the Sky Islands**

The Sky Islands are a place of endless mystery, their true nature and origins forever shrouded in the clouds that surround them. But make no mistake, these islands are real, and their secrets are within our grasp.

Some believe that the islands are a test, a challenge set by the gods to see who among mortals is worthy of their gifts. Others think that the islands are a sanctuary, a place of refuge for those seeking to escape the troubles of the world below. Still, others argue that the islands are a prison, holding ancient evils that must never be unleashed.

There are even those who claim that the Sky Islands are alive, sentient beings that move of their own will, drifting through the skies in search of something known only to them. These living islands are said to be capable of great kindness or great cruelty, depending on how they are approached.

But whatever the truth may be, one thing is certain—the Sky Islands are real, and they are waiting for those brave enough to uncover their secrets.
