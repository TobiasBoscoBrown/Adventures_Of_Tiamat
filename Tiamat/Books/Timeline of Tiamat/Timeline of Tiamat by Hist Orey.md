### **Introduction**

Much is known about the great history of Tiamat, as many of our ancestors kept detailed records of their deeds and accomplishments. However, I have noticed that piecing together Tiamat's history at a glance has become increasingly difficult due to the sheer volume of information. With this in mind, I decided to embark on the creation of this book—a concise account where one can glimpse Tiamat’s main events and milestones without needing to wade through endless archives detailing every king's favorite pet.

Very little is actually known about the origins of Tiamat 6,000 years ago. Numerous stories have emerged over the millennia, but one central narrative seems to have gained the most acceptance. The era preceding Tiamat's rule, known as **B.T. (Before Tiamat),** is shrouded in mystery, with only fragments of tales passed down through generations. I have done my best to piece together the events of this time, though it must be noted that much of this period is likely steeped in myth and legend. Nevertheless, I present to you the story as it has been passed down.

## **Part 2: Detailed Accounts of the Events**

### **The Era Before Tiamat (B.T.)**

#### **Creation of the Universe**

The creation of the universe is steeped in mystery and myth. It is said that Tiamat, the great dragon deity, existed in the ether before the world was formed. She battled The Old Gods, and their clashes resulted in the creation of the physical universe. Stars were born from the fireballs of Tiamat’s breath, and planets were formed from the debris of her exhalations. The most violent clashes resulted in black holes, where the forces of Tiamat and The Old Gods collided.

The battle raged for eons, with neither side willing to concede. Eventually, The Old Gods gained the upper hand, and Tiamat, gravely injured, began to fall. As she descended, she managed to get one deep scratch in on her adversaries. Her fall marked the end of the cosmic battle and the beginning of the physical world's stabilization.

#### **10 B.T.: The Fall of Tiamat**

In **10 B.T.,** Tiamat fell to the world she had helped create, her body crashing into the land and creating a fertile area that would later become the heart of Tulorian. Her death marked the end of the cosmic battle and the beginning of the physical world's stabilization. The Elves, fleeing from the great tragedy that had befallen the Imperial Kingdom, witnessed Tiamat's fall as they sailed toward a new world. Othorian Nel was born during this exodus, and at the age of 10, he saw Tiamat's descent.

#### **1 A.T.: The Founding of Tulorian**

The Elves, guided by the omen of Tiamat's fall, landed their ships in the fertile land created by her impact. They established the city of Tulorian in **1 A.T.,** marking the beginning of the Age of Tiamat. Under the leadership of Othorian Nel, Tulorian became the center of Elven culture and civilization in this new world.

### **The First Thousand Years: Foundation and Growth**

#### **214 A.T.: The Battle of the Minds**

In the early centuries of Tiamat, the Elves were united in their purpose, but as time went on, differences in philosophy began to emerge. The Battle of the Minds, which took place in **214 A.T.,** was a pivotal event that led to the division of the Elves into two distinct factions: the Wood Elves, who sought to live in harmony with nature, and the High Elves, who pursued progress and innovation. This split marked the first significant cultural shift in Tulorian.

#### **457 A.T.: Arrival of the Dwarves**

The arrival of the Dwarves in **457 A.T.** introduced a new dynamic to Tiamat. Known for their craftsmanship and resilience, the Dwarves quickly established themselves in the mountains, founding KneeStone Mines in **481 A.T.** under the leadership of Thror Stonehammer, who was born in **782 A.T.** Their presence brought new opportunities for trade but also occasional tensions with the Elves and later, the Humans.

#### **946 A.T.: The Orcs Arrive**

The Orcs, a warrior race with a strong sense of honor and territory, arrived on Tiamat in **946 A.T.** They founded the city of Hell in **958 A.T.,** and their aggressive expansionism soon led to conflicts with both the Elves and Dwarves.

#### **989 A.T.: The First Blight**

The First Blight appeared in **989 A.T.,** bringing widespread fear and uncertainty. Crops withered, and entire regions were struck by disease. Strangely, just as quickly as it appeared, the Blight faded away without any intervention, leaving scholars puzzled and marking the end of the Good Era of Peace.

### **1063 A.T. - 6000 A.T.: The Age of Humanity and Continued Challenges**

#### **1063 A.T.: The Humans Arrive**

In **1063 A.T.,** the first Humans arrived on Tiamat, escaping the calamities of their homeland. Their arrival was initially welcomed by the Elves and Dwarves, and they quickly established settlements, including the cities of Cardious, Harven, Kubi, and Nodo in the following decades.

#### **1630 A.T. - 1800 A.T.: The Elven-Human War and the Great Orcish War**

The founding of Chin in **1630 A.T.** by Humans marked the beginning of rising tensions that would eventually lead to the Elven-Human War. When the Elves discovered Chin's involvement in dark magic and weapon production, they destroyed the city in **1680 A.T.,** sparking a war that would last nearly two decades. The war ended in **1699 A.T.** with the defeat of the Humans and the ascension of Othorian Nel as the sole King of Tiamat.

The weakened state of the Elves and Humans following the war led to the Great Orcish War, beginning in **1710 A.T.,** when the Orcs launched an invasion. The war culminated in **1740 A.T.,** with the joint forces of Elves and Humans, led by Othorian Nel and Jarnath, defeating the Orcs. The Orcish city of Hell was renamed Grudge, and the Orcs were heavily sanctioned.

#### **2000 A.T.: The Second Blight**

In **2000 A.T.,** the Second Blight appeared, echoing the mysterious patterns of the First Blight. It caused widespread fear but once again faded without any clear cause, leaving scholars and mages puzzled.

### **2850 A.T. - 6000 A.T.: Exploration, Conflicts, and Mysterious Events**

#### **2850 A.T.: Discovery of the Northern Isles**

The discovery of the Northern Isles in **2850 A.T.** sparked a new era of exploration. Adventurers and traders sailed to these distant lands, establishing new trade routes and founding the city of Silvermist in **3450 A.T.**

#### **3239 A.T.: The Great Goat Incident**

The Great Goat Incident of **3239 A.T.** remains one of the most peculiar events in Tiamat's history. Although its exact details are unclear, it has become a legend, often cited in stories and songs.

#### **3990 A.T.: The Third Blight**

The Third Blight appeared in **3990 A.T.,** continuing the pattern of appearing every thousand years. Like its predecessors, it faded without explanation, adding to the growing list of unanswered questions surrounding these mysterious events.

#### **4500 A.T.: The Destruction of Puke**

The city of Puke, founded in **4401 A.T.,** was destroyed by a Dragonborn raid in **4500 A.T.** The attack marked the arrival of the Dragonborn on Tiamat, and they began to slowly populate the continent starting in **4510 A.T.**

#### **4643 A.T.: The Great Lake Separation**

The Great Lake of Tiamat, once a single vast body of water, separated into Nown Lake, Life Lake, and Dragon Lake in **4643 A.T.** This event had significant cultural and political implications for the region, as the lakes were considered sacred by both the Elves and Humans.

#### **4930 A.T.: The Fourth Blight**

The Fourth Blight appeared in **4930 A.T.,** following the pattern of the previous ones, and faded as mysteriously as it came. Its occurrence, however, only deepened the sense of unease and foreboding among the people of Tiamat.

#### **5121 A.T.: New Lorian is renamed Hell's Barrow due to frequent raids.**

By **5121 A.T.,** New Lorian, plagued by frequent raids, was renamed Hell's Barrow, a testament to the constant strife that had come to define the region.

#### **5200 A.T.: The Treaty of Unity**

In response to rising external threats, the Treaty of Unity was signed in **5200 A.T.,** formally solidifying the alliance between the Elves, Humans, and Dwarves. This treaty ensured that Tiamat would be defended by a united front, preventing any one race from becoming too dominant.

#### **5500 A.T.: Increasing Orcish Raids**

By **5500 A.T.,** Orcish raids had become increasingly regular across Tiamat. Despite the growing frequency of these attacks, King Grudge of the Orcs denies any involvement, claiming no connection to the raiders. This has left the other races wary of the true intentions behind these raids, further straining relations.

#### **5890 A.T.: The Fifth Blight**

The Fifth Blight appeared in **5890 A.T.,** bringing with it a sense of dread to the people of Tiamat. Unlike the previous Blights, this one has not faded away, leading to growing concern and unease among scholars, rulers, and the general populace.

#### **6000 A.T.: Present Day**

As Tiamat enters the current year of **6000 A.T.,** the continent remains technically at peace, but tensions are running high. The unresolved Blight, frequent Orcish raids, and the ever-present threat of old rivalries resurfacing have left Tiamat on edge. The people of Tiamat must navigate these uncertain times, drawing on the lessons of their long and storied history while remaining vigilant of the challenges ahead.

_May the lessons of our past guide the footsteps of our future._
