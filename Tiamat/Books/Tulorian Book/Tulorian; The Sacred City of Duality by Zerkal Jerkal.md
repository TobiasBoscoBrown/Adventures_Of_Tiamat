## **Introduction**

Tulorian, our blessed city of duality, stands as a living testament to the complex and intertwined histories of Elves and Humans—a city where the influence of Tiamat is ever-present. Nestled between three sacred lakes, Tulorian is not just a place of residence; it is a beacon of cooperation, a crucible of conflict, and an enduring monument to our shared legacy. Over the ages, this city has borne witness to the rise and fall of empires, the clash of cultures, and the blending of traditions. As a half-elf, born of both Elven and Human heritage, and a cleric of the Church of Tiamat, I feel it is my sacred duty to share the deep lore of Tulorian, illuminating the mysteries and histories that have shaped our beloved city.

## **Chapter 1: The Origin and Evolution of Tulorian**

Tulorian, as we know it, derives its name from the ancient Elvish word _Tulor,_ meaning "Sanctuary" or "Haven." In **1 A.T.,** under the guidance of Othorian Nel, the first Elven settlers established this city as a refuge—a place where Elven culture and wisdom could flourish amidst the vast and untamed lands of Tiamat. The Elves, keenly attuned to the natural world, recognized this land as special, with natural beauty and energies that spoke to their spirits.

As time passed and Humans, seeking refuge from disasters in their own lands, arrived in Tiamat, they were drawn to Tulorian in **1063 A.T.** Our forebears saw the wisdom in cooperation, and Tulorian became a shared sanctuary, where Elves and Humans could coexist, though not without its challenges. "Tulorian," therefore, came to symbolize not just a haven for the Elves, but a shared destiny for all who dwell within its borders.

### **1 A.T.: The Founding of Tulorian**

In the first year after Tiamat’s passing, the Elves, guided by Othorian Nel, founded Tulorian. This site was chosen not only for its natural beauty and defenses but also for the sacred connection to the land that the lakes provided. The interconnected waters served as both protection and sustenance, ensuring that Tulorian would flourish as a sanctuary for those who sought peace and wisdom.

### **1630 A.T. - 1680 A.T.: The Elven-Human War**

As Humanity spread across Tiamat, new cities sprang up, including Chin, built dangerously close to Tulorian in **1630 A.T.** The proximity of Chin to our city sparked immense tension, leading to its destruction in **1680 A.T.** after the discovery of dangerous practices within its borders. The Elves, in their determination to protect Tulorian, ignited the Elven-Human War. This conflict, though painful, served as a test of resilience for both races.

### **1800 A.T.: The Great Orcish War and the Alliance**

In **1800 A.T.,** after years of war and the devastating Great Orcish War, Othorian Nel, in his wisdom, allowed Humans to share political power in Tiamat. This decision, supported by the Church of Tiamat, ensured that Tulorian would become the heart of a united Tiamat, where Elves and Humans could govern together. The lakes, though now separated, symbolized the unity we sought to achieve, even as their gradual separation mirrored the challenges we faced.

### **4643 A.T.: The Separation of the Great Lake of Tiamat**

The event of **4643 A.T.** is a turning point in our history, when the Great Lake of Tiamat, which once encircled the city, separated into the three lakes we know today—Dragon Lake, Nown Lake, and the Lake of Life. This event, though tragic, serves as a reminder of the delicate balance we must maintain. It is said that this separation reflects the growing divide between Elves and Humans, and it is a call for us to seek unity and cooperation.

## **Chapter 2: The Sacred Lakes of Tulorian**

Tulorian is defined not only by its people but also by the three sacred lakes that embrace it—Dragon Lake, Nown Lake, and the Lake of Life. These lakes are central to the city’s lore and play a significant role in its culture.

### **Dragon Lake**

To the south of Tulorian lies Dragon Lake, a cauldron of seething heat and raw power. According to legend, Dragon Lake was formed from the fiery breath of Tiamat, the great dragon deity. The waters of Dragon Lake are not ordinary—they are, in fact, a potent potion of strength. Those who partake in its waters are said to gain unparalleled physical power, a gift from the land itself. The lake’s waters are so hot that they never freeze, even in the harshest winters, and the rising steam gives the surrounding area a mystical atmosphere.

### **Nown Lake**

To the north of our city, in stark contrast to the fiery Dragon Lake, lies Nown Lake. This lake is frigid, its waters crystal clear, and it is believed to be a source of wisdom. The waters of Nown Lake are more than just cold—they are a potion of intelligence, granting those who drink from it enhanced mental clarity and insight. The calm, cold waters reflect the measured, strategic nature that those who partake in it often seek.

### **Lake of Life**

At the heart of Tulorian, between Dragon Lake and Nown Lake, lies the sacred Lake of Life. This warm, nurturing lake is the lifeblood of Tulorian, a source of sustenance for the flora and fauna that populate Tiamat. The Elves believe that the Lake of Life is where life on Tiamat began—not for the people who sailed here, but for the vibrant foliage, the majestic animals, and even the mighty dragons that call this land home. Its waters are said to be a potion of healing, capable of curing even the gravest of wounds and ailments. The Lake of Life’s importance cannot be overstated, for it sustains the very essence of Tiamat's natural world.

In ancient times, these three lakes were interconnected, forming a single, vast body of water that encircled Tulorian. However, as the centuries passed, and notably after the event of **4643 A.T.,** the lakes began to recede and separate—a phenomenon that has troubled both Elves and Humans alike. Each side has, regrettably, blamed the other for this decline, accusing each other of overuse and misuse of these sacred waters. The shrinking of the Lake of Life has become a particularly sore point, with both races fearing that its loss could bring ruin to the natural balance of Tiamat.

Given the sacred nature of these lakes, it is **strictly forbidden** for anyone to swim in or draw water from them without the express permission of both Othorian Nel and the current Human King. Such acts are considered sacrilege, and violators face the harshest of penalties, for we believe that unauthorized use of these holy waters could hasten their decline and bring misfortune to the land.

## **Chapter 3: Sacred Traditions and Interactions**

Tulorian, blessed by its unique heritage, is rich in traditions, cultural significance, and magical interactions, all of which are deeply connected to the lakes that surround us.

### **The Festival of Radiant Dawn**

Held once every decade, the Festival of Radiant Dawn is a city-wide celebration where both Elves and Humans come together to honor their shared traditions. The Elves illuminate the House of Nel and Magic Citadel with enchanted lights, while the Humans hold grand processions leading to the Temple of Tiamat. The festival culminates in a ceremony at the Tree of Eternity, where leaders from both sides join in unity, celebrating the peace and cooperation that Tulorian represents.

### **The Silver Guard and the Knights of the Flame**

Tulorian is protected by two elite forces—the Silver Guard, who patrol Eldergrove in enchanted silver armor, and the Knights of the Flame, who ensure the security of New Dawn. Both orders are fiercely loyal to their respective leaders, and though they often find themselves at odds, they are united in their duty to protect Tulorian and uphold the values of the city.

### **The Council of Balance**

Governance in Tulorian is entrusted to the **Council of Balance,** a body composed equally of Elven and Human representatives, led by the two most influential figures in Tulorian: Othorian Nel, the Elven leader, and the current Human King. These two leaders guide the council, ensuring that decisions reflect the needs and interests of both races.

In recognition of the unique role that half-elves play in bridging the gap between these two cultures, the Council includes special provisions that allow half-elves to serve as councilors. This decision honors the unity that Tulorian represents and acknowledges the contributions of those who, like myself, carry the blood of both races.

The Council of Balance meets alternately at the **House of Nel** and the **House of Rex,** ensuring that no single race holds more influence over the decisions that shape our city. Each day, the Council gathers in one of these grand halls to deliberate on matters of state, trade, and law, striving to maintain the delicate balance that is essential for our continued coexistence. As a half-elf cleric and councilor, I am deeply aware of the responsibility I bear—to honor both sides of my heritage and to seek wisdom in all things.

### **The Church of Tiamat**

The Church of Tiamat, my spiritual home and the guiding light of Human society in Tulorian, is more than a place of worship—it is the cornerstone of our civilization. Deeply intertwined with Human politics, the Church’s influence can be seen in every aspect of life within New Dawn. The grand Temple of Tiamat, where I humbly serve, is not only a place of prayer but also a center of governance, where the High Priest oversees both spiritual and temporal matters. The teachings of the Church emphasize that Tiamat is the creator and protector of humanity, and it is our sacred duty to honor her legacy and ensure that her will is carried out across Tiamat.

## **Conclusion**

Tulorian, the city of duality, is more than just a place—it is a living testament to the complex and intertwined histories of Elves and Humans, a sacred space where the influence of Tiamat is ever-present. Through the ages, Tulorian has been a beacon of hope, a crucible of conflict, and a monument to our shared destiny.

As a half-elf cleric and councilor, I am humbled to serve in this holy city, to walk the paths laid down by our ancestors, and to be part of the ongoing story of Tulorian. It is my hope that this humble account will not only illuminate the deep and sacred lore of our city but also inspire all who read it to honor the legacy we have inherited, and to work towards the peace and unity that Tulorian represents.

May the wisdom of our ancestors guide us always, and may Tulorian continue to stand as a shining example of what can be achieved when we embrace cooperation and balance with open hearts and unwavering faith.
