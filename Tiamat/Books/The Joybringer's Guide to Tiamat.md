## **The Sacred Words of Lliira**

**Hear the words of Lliira, Our Lady of Joy, Mistress of Revels, the Everchanging Goddess who dances across the stars. In her name, we celebrate the gifts of freedom, happiness, and light.**

### **1. The Dance of Life**

_"Life is a dance, and every step is precious. Move with joy, for the dance is not forever."_

Rejoice, for each breath is a gift, and every heartbeat a rhythm of the divine. Let no day pass without laughter, no night fall without celebration. Dance in the sun, and sing to the moon. For in the dance of life, we find the spirit of Lliira.

### **2. The Path of Freedom**

_"To live is to be free, and to be free is to embrace the spirit of Lliira."_

Hold fast to your freedom, for it is a sacred gift. Break the chains of fear and sorrow. In every step you take, let your heart be light, your spirit unburdened. Seek no power over others, but offer them the freedom to dance beside you.

### **3. The Celebration of Joy**

_"Celebrate all things, great and small, for in joy, you shall find the essence of the divine."_

Rejoice in the changing of the seasons, in the smallest flower, in the laughter of a child. Know that every moment, whether filled with song or silence, is a chance to honor Our Lady of Joy. Let no sorrow linger longer than its lesson, for all things pass, and joy returns like the dawn.

### **4. The Light of Kindness**

_"Spread light, for it is the greatest gift you can give."_

Be gentle, be kind, and let your heart shine with the light of compassion. The Joybringer turns away from violence and ill will. When conflict arises, offer peace; when darkness threatens, be the first to light the torch. Let your laughter be a comfort and your dance a blessing to those who have lost their way.

### **5. The Blessing of Lliira**

_"To those who seek joy, I give my blessing. To those who spread joy, I give my love."_

Remember, O faithful, that Lliiraâ€™s blessing is upon those who embrace her ways. She favors those who delight in the dance, who cherish freedom, and who seek to spread happiness wherever they go. In your celebrations, she is with you; in your sorrow, she brings comfort.

### **6. The Warnings of Our Lady**

_"Do not bring discord to the revels, for my presence will fade from those who mar the joy of others."_

Beware, for Our Lady turns away from violence and hatred. To draw a sword in anger or to darken the joy of others is to lose her blessing. If you seek her favor, keep your heart light and your hands clean of harm. Walk in peace, and she shall walk with you.

### **7. The Eternal Revel**

_"Let every gathering be a festival, every meeting a celebration."_

Wherever you gather in my name, let there be music and laughter. Create sanctuaries of joy in every town, villages of peace in every city. Let the temples be places of light, where no sorrow enters and no grief remains. This is my will: that the world becomes a place of endless revelry, where the spirit is forever free.

Lliira's light shall ever blaze.**

And may our hearts forever dance  
In the light of your joy."**
