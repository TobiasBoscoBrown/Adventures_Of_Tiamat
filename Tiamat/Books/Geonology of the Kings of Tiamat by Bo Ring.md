### **Othorian Nel**

- **Born:** 10 B.T.
- **Came into Power:** 1700 A.T.
- **Reign:** 1700 A.T. - Present (6000 A.T.)

**Othorian Nel** is the first and only Elven King of Tiamat, having ruled since 1700 A.T. After his victory in the Elven-Human War in 1699 A.T., he became the sole ruler of Tiamat. However, following the Great Orcish War in 1800 A.T., Othorian decided that the best way to maintain peace and stability across the continent was to share power with the Humans. This led to the establishment of a dual monarchy, where a Human King would rule alongside him. This decision helped to unite Tiamat under a shared leadership, promoting cooperation between Elves and Humans.

Under Othorian's leadership, Tiamat has experienced both great prosperity and significant challenges. He is known for his wisdom, strength, and ability to maintain peace between the races through the establishment of the Council of Balance, which governs alongside the dual monarchy. His reign has seen the rise of new cities, exploration, and the ongoing struggle with the recurring Blights that periodically afflict Tiamat.
