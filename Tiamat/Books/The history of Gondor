2467 A.T.: The Founding of Gondor
Gondor’s origins trace back to 2467 A.T., during a period of Dwarven expansion driven by the discovery of rich mineral veins in the Spine of Tiamat. The region's deep mountains promised vast wealth, and the Dwarven clans, including the Hardheart and Fireheart families, were among the first to seize the opportunity. Gondor was established as a fortress city, strategically located to exploit the precious resources buried within the mountains.

The founding of Gondor wasn’t without its challenges. The area was fraught with danger, from treacherous terrain to frequent raids by Orcs and other mountain-dwelling creatures. The early settlers were hardy, determined to carve out a home in the mountains. The Hardhearts, renowned for their military prowess, took on the role of defenders, while the Firehearts, master blacksmiths, and metallurgists, focused on building the city’s infrastructure.

The Mines of Gondor
The true lifeblood of Gondor was its mines. These mines, carved deep into the mountains, yielded not only iron and gold but also the rare and highly coveted mithril. The KneeStone Mines, established in 481 A.T., became particularly famous for their rich deposits of mithril. The Firehearts, with their unmatched skill in metallurgy, transformed these raw materials into the finest weapons and armor in Tiamat. Gondor’s forges produced legendary weapons, such as the blade Stonecleaver and the shield Ironwall, both of which were said to be unbreakable in battle.

However, the mines were not without peril. Dwarven miners told tales of strange creatures lurking in the depths, creatures that were never seen but whose presence was felt in the echoes of the dark tunnels. These creatures, known only as the Deep Ones, were said to be guardians of the earth’s treasures, and miners who delved too greedily were rumored to disappear without a trace. Some believed the Deep Ones were ancient spirits, others thought they were beasts from forgotten times. Regardless of the truth, the mines remained a source of both wealth and fear.

The Hardheart and Fireheart Families
The Hardheart and Fireheart families were the pillars upon which Gondor was built. The Hardhearts, fierce and unyielding, provided the military strength needed to defend the city and its mines from Orcish raiders and other threats. Their stronghold, the House of Hardheart, became a symbol of Gondor’s resilience, a place where strategies were devised, and wars were won.

The Firehearts, on the other hand, were known for their unmatched craftsmanship. Their forge, located in the heart of Gondor, was the source of the city’s most valuable exports. Weapons, armor, and tools forged in the Fireheart Forge were sought after throughout Tiamat, making Gondor a center of trade and commerce.

Despite their contributions, the two families were often at odds. The Hardhearts pushed for aggressive expansion and conquest, believing that Gondor’s future lay in controlling more territory. The Firehearts, however, preferred to focus on innovation and trade, arguing that Gondor’s prosperity depended on its ability to maintain and improve its existing resources. This philosophical divide would come to define the political landscape of Gondor for centuries.

Lore Stories of Gondor
The Curse of the Deep Ones: One of the most enduring legends in Gondor is that of the Deep Ones—mysterious creatures said to dwell in the deepest parts of the mines. According to the legend, these creatures are the remnants of an ancient race, cursed to guard the earth’s treasures for eternity. Miners who have ventured too far into the depths have reported hearing strange, echoing whispers and seeing shadows that move of their own accord. Those who disappear are said to have fallen victim to the Deep Ones, never to be seen again.

The Blade of Stonecleaver: Among the many weapons forged in Gondor, none is more famous than Stonecleaver, a sword said to be so sharp it could cut through solid rock. Forged by the Firehearts in the early days of Gondor, Stonecleaver was wielded by many of Gondor’s greatest warriors. According to legend, the blade was enchanted by the Deep Ones themselves, who granted it the power to cleave through anything in return for a promise that the blade would never be used to harm the earth. The sword was lost during a great battle, and despite numerous attempts to find it, Stonecleaver remains hidden somewhere within the Spine of Tiamat.

The Strange Noises in the Sewers: Maurice, Gondor’s eccentric architect, has long claimed that strange noises can be heard in the city’s sewers, a system he designed himself. While many dismiss his claims as the ravings of a madman, there are those who believe that Maurice might be onto something. Strange noises have been reported coming from the sewers at night—growls, hisses, and the sound of wings beating in the darkness. Whether this is true or merely the result of Maurice’s overactive imagination, the legend of the sewer noises continues to be a source of intrigue and fear in Gondor.

The Worship of Oktober: The Dwarves of Gondor are devout followers of Oktober, the God of Drink and Heartiness. Oktober is a beloved deity who is said to ride across the skies on a golden sleigh pulled by an army of pugs. The Dwarves celebrate Oktober with grand feasts and endless mugs of ale, honoring him at the Temple of Oktober, which stands proudly in the heart of Gondor. It’s said that those who truly devote themselves to Oktober can drink for days on end without feeling the ill effects. His blessings are especially sought during times of hardship, as it’s believed that Oktober’s laughter can chase away even the darkest of times.
