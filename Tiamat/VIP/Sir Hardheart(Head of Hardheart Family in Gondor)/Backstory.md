Sir Hardheart was born in 5940 A.T. His father married Sir Fireheart's

mother after an Orc Raid killed his father. The two joined the family

and were able to bring order, but he hated his step brother. He focused

on being able to brew amazing bears that could make the strongest of men

pass out. He has a personal vendetta against all Hardhearts, but he has

a lot of respect for his king. He works in his bar, and is the best

brewer in all of Tiamat.
