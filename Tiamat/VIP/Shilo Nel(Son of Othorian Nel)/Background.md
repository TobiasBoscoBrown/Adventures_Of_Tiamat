Shilo Nel was born in 5345 A.T. He is the son of Othorian Nel. He has

really big shoes to fill. He believe because of his heritage he is

better than everyone else. He wants to rule the entire kingdom and

thinks the Humans are not worthy of holding any power. He is heir to the

throne. He is evil, but biding his time for possibly thousands of years.

He is smart, cunning, and an asshole.
