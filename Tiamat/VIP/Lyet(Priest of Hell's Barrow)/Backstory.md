Lyet was born 5930 A.T. and was the priest at the Church of Tiamat in

Hell's Barrow. He chose not to abandon the Temple no matter what

happened. He witnessed his town get pretty much slaughtered by Gith

invaders. He saved as many as he could, but everyone who survived wanted

to leave, leaving him alone. He was tasked with protecting a family

heirloom that has been passed down generation to generation waiting for

the chosen ones to come take it away. This heirloom of course is the

green egg shell of Tiamat. He hates anyone who has any semblance of evil

or power that is not from Tiamat. He will punish the evil. He helped

raise Vrabardoc, however one day after learning his true nature

attempted to kill him in his sleep, however he disappeared before he

could hurt him.
