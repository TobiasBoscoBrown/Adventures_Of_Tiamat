Sue Alloe was born 5961 A.T. She was born and raised in Nodo, the throat
of Tiamat. Her parents were murdered at a young age, but she toughed it
out, lived in the slums, and grew up to become a very hard worker and
great leader. She doesn't take any shit, and takes really good care of
her people. She is investigating Daniel Fairisles for corruption as she
thinks she has something to do with the Thieves Guild keeping her town
in poverty. She is actually a good leader, but her town suffers, while
Daniel is a bad leader while his town prospers.
