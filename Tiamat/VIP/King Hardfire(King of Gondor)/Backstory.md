King Hardfire was born 5935 in Gondor. His family comes from Hardheart

and Fireheart lines, and he his the leader of them both. He tries to

unite the two families, however they hate each other. I think his

charisma is kinda like the wizard king's. He is calm, understanding, and

listens to both sides. He loves the riches of the mountains, and can't

get enough. He is secretly hiding a baby black dragon that he intends to

raise so that he can use it to kill all of the goblins in the mountains.

In his early days, he helped build his city up from nothing. He dug into

the mountain and got riches so they he could give his dwarven people a

home.
