Mourning Nel was born in 140 A.T. His mother died in childbirth due to

complications, and his father died of grief soon after. This is why he

was given the name Mourning. At the age of 74, he decided to create a

sect of Elves that were not moving towards advancements of civilization.

He believed that it was these things that caused his parents to die. He

became the first Wood Elf, and brought over many Elves to the Quielent

Forest in order to leave a more simple life. He trains not as hard, and

normally does not concern himself with the ways of the world.
