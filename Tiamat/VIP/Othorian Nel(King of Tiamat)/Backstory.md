Othorian Nel was born 10 in B.T. He's seen pretty much everything. He

was born while a great tragedy was occuring from the Imperial Continent.

He knows about it, but no-one else in the entire continent does. When

Othorian was 10 years old, while he was sailing away from the Old

Continent, he witnessed Tiamat falling from the sky. They landed there

and learned about Tiamats plan to reincarnate with the Speck of Time.

They broke the egg, and spent a long time scattering the remnants across

the continent. Then the founded Tulorian. Othorian's parents soon died,

and he found himself being in charge of Tulorian at a very young age of

150. In 214 A.T. his younger brother Mourning Nel created a new sect of

Elves called the Wood Elves. They went to the Quielent Forest to live as

one with nature. in 457 A.T. Othorian attempted to create good relations

with the newly arrived Dwarves. However due to his youth and the Dwarves

rough personality, he did not establish friendship. In 946 A.T. He once

again attempted have good first impressions with the Orcs. They were

worse than the Dwarves, and soon territorial battles began to wage

between the races. However then a blight began to spread. After

investigation and meditation, he understood that Mt. Elderchrono and the

Speck of Time was sucking away life due to Tiamats power fighting back.

He met with Novachrono and created a plan to save the land of Tiamat.

Ressurecting Tiamat, and then destroying him again would allow for the

health of Tiamat to be reborn as well. Novachrono gave his power to

Othorian, Great Hellbringer, and Thror Stonehammer. This brought everyone

together in peace against the common enemy of Tiamat. Then in 1063 A.T.

he was wiser and more patient when the humans arrived. He let them have

free reign for a while. However he was unaware of the greed and emotions

of the Humans. Their freedom allowed them to spread lies about Tiamat

across the land. This is when Othorian decided to hide the Truth that

Tiamat was evil and that they had to kill her every thousand years in

order to keep the land healty. Humans spread, and became a threat once

they settled in Kin, right next to Tulorian. Eventually Othorian felt he

had no choice but to declare war on the Humans in order to preserve

Tiamat. He led the fight against the humans in the Elven Human War. He

fought Jarnath, and won, seemingly ending the war. He then threatened

and attempted to contain Jarnath. Humans however persisted in their

fighting. Othorian Nel destroyed Nether to prevent Jarnath fighting back

again. Then when the Orcs began their attack as well, Othorian

eventually caved in and joined forces with the Humans to create peace

back into the land of Tiamat. While this battle was raging, The Blight

began again. Othorian could not take time out to rekill Tiamat, so he

asked Novachrono to pick others. When they finnaly won the Great Orcish

War, Othorian and the Humans gained equal power over the land of Tiamat.

They put down the Great Orc Rebellion. Othorian has been ruling Tiamat

along with Human Kings for thousands of years now. He still has Jarnath

as a thorn in his side all the time, but he maintains order and control.

He continues to get stronger year after year. In 5345 A.T. he had a son,

Shilo Nel.
