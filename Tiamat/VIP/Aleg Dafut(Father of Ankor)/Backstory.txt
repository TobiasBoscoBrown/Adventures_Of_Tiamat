Born in 5940, Aleg Dafut is a devout worshiper of Tiamat. When he was
younger he got reckless and made Ashin with a woman he'd never met. He
now regrets that and tries to live up to his son. Ashin wanted to go on
an adventure, but Aleg became ill and his son stayed to help him.
Secretly he wanted this because he did not want his son going out into
the world and all it's evil. He is 60 at this point and getting very
old. Because of his diet, and sickness, he is not going to live for very
long.
