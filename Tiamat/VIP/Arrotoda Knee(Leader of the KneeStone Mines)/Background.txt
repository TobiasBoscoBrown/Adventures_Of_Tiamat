Arrotoda was born in 5950 A.T. He is in a very long line of dwarves that
have been mining at the KneeStone mines for thousands of years.
(Everyone here has Boston accents.) He has a wife; Dis Knee. He has a
lot of gold, power, and stones. His riches are some of the most vast in
all of Tiamat. However, he as well as everyone in the Knee line has a
limp. He is very wise and an amazing leader. However he's had trouble
with the underdark, particularly Mind Flayers in his mines. He will do
anything to protect his men.
