Sir Fireheart was born in 5940 A.T. His mother married Sir Hardheart's
father after an Orc Raid killed his father. The two joined the family
and were able to bring order, but he hated his step brother. He focused
on being able to build weapons and tools so that his people could
survive. He has a personal vendetta against all Hardhearts, but he has a
lot of respect for his king. He works in his blacksmith shop, and is the
best blacksmith in all of Tiamat.
