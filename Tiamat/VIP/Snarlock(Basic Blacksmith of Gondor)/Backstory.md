Snarlock was born 5950 A.T. He's a decent blacksmith at the Ass N Iron

in Gondor. He gets shit on a lot, but doesn't really know it. He's got a

really angry looking face, but he's not a bad guy once you get to know

him. Most people hate him, he's drunk all the time, has no sense of

smell, and can put iron together.
