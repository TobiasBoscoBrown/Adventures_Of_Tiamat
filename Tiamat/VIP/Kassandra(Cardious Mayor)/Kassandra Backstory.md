Kassandra Hearstone was born and raised in Cardious 5970 A.T. She was a

reckless child and got into a lot of trouble fighting. She trained hard,

and once protected her town from an orcish invasion at 16. She continues

to train and gain strength. One day her parents were killed by

assassinators trying to rebuild the Orcish Order. She became the leader

of her town when she captured and slayed the assassinators. She falls

for no man or woman and her love is the sword. She trains casually with

dragons and loves to get drunk and get into arm wrestling matches with

strong looking me. (Think Gina Carano) She's a hard worker and keeps her

people safe from all disasters. She believes that the town should be the

capital of Tiamat as it is the Heart of Tiamat, but she won't cause

trouble by that belief. She is a down to Tiamat kinda gal and loves life

and her people. She continues to lead them year after year, growing

stronger loving everyone. She has totally slept with Jarnath a few

times.
