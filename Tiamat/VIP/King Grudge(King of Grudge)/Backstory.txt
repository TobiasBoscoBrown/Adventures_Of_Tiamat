King Grudge was born 5960 A.T. He comes from a line of Orcs called the
Hellbringers. However, once the Hellbringer family lost in the great
Orcish War and became known as the Grudge family. The Grudge family then
started the Great Orc Rebellion. They lost, but they still want to
conquer Tiamat in the name of the Hellbringers, and get rid of the name
Grudge. King Grudge is now building an army to one day attack the humans
and elves once more. He has 1000 Soldiers. Now he is just waiting for a
good time to strike. He no longer associates with the Orcish Order, but
he was friends with Scree Dangar.
