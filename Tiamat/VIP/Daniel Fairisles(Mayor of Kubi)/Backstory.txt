Daniel Fairisles was born 5962 A.T. He is the mayor of Kubi. He is a
respectable man to his peers and his family. However, he knowingly lets
the Thieves Guild run rampant in the city and takes a portion of the
money. In the public eye, he is a very good leader and man, but in the
shadows he betrays everyone. He married Sandra so that he could have
some power in the church. He still wants to gain more political power,
which is why he set up his daughter to marry into the Royal Rex Family.
He even created a plot to kill the King Charles Rex by slowly poisoning
him with his ambassador to Tulorian. He wants to become King, spread the
Thieves guild, and become the most powerful man of all of Tiamat. He's
willing to do anything to achieve his goal.
