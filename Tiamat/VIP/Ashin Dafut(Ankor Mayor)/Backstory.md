Ashin Dafut was born in 5958 A.T. His father is the leader at the Church

of Tiamat in Ankor. He lives a simple life, worships Tiamat, and eats

his vegetables. He makes little money as does the rest of his town by

fishing. He once yearned for adventure, but when his father fell ill he

decided to stay and help him recover. Now he is growing old, no kids,

and just trying to keep this old town afloat. The fish aren't biting as

much and the soil gets worse every year.
