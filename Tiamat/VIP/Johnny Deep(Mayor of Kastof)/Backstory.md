Johnny Deep was born 5950 A.T. He is the mayor of Kastoff. He was born

to the sea, on a ship. He loves the ocean, and he adopted the Wright

brothers and helped build ships with them. He is a avid fisher, someone

who has had a lot of adventures, and a great father. He is a self taught

sorcerer, and usually uses that to build ships better. He looks like

he's been out on sea a little too long, because one time he got lost out

there. He is a little crazy now.
