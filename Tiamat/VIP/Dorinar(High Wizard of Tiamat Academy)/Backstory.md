Dorinar was born in 5810 A.T. He's clean shaven, smart for his kind. A

high ranking professor at a wizard Tiamat Academy. He works with

Sileisil and Goffrey and they look really amazing for their age. They

worked together to trap Atum decades ago, unaware that he has recently

gotten out. He is a great wizard, but doesn't match Silesil's power. He

is aware of the pact Silesil has made with Tiamat but says nothing to

keep staying alive. After the problem with Atum, the old college was

shut down. So they all moved back to Tiamat Academy where they were

taught and began teaching there.
