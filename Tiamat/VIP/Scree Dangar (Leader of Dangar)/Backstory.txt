Scree Dangar was born 5960 A.T. He is the leader of Dangar, a small
orchish town at the end of the Seikatsu River. He takes a lot of shit,
and holds grudges against everyone upstream from his town. He and his
friends assassinated the leaders of Cardious, but he was the only one
who escaped. His fighting days are pretty much over, but there is
something out at sea that is scaring his villagers. At night it
sometimes comes to shore and rummages through their trash to eat it.
That's why he has setup defences. He believes that the Orcs are the
rightful owner of Tiamat, and wants to go to war to reclaim it, but for
now, he just sits alone in Dangar. He comes from a line of Orcs that
fought during the great Orcish War called the Orcish Order, but his old
descendants died and were killed by Jarnath.
