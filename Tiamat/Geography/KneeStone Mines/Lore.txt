Lore of The KneeStone Mines

1. These mines are the Kidney Stones that Tiamat had.

2. They are shaped like kidneys. One deeper than the other because of
how Tiamat landed. Tiamats Kidney Stones are really rich with precious
metals and diamonds.

3. East of the Quilent Forest, South of Nether, West of Ankor, and North
of the Ender Sea.

4. Directly above the underdark. Mind Flayers about. There is a red
dragon trapped under there attempting to be trained to overthrow the
mines for the Mind Flayers.

5. You want gold, you go here.

6. Also Vranardoc would probably like to have a red dragon considering
that his mom made a deal with Tiamat that red dragons are subservient to
Gith Yankees.
