**1. Reason for Name**

Tulorian derives its name from the ancient Elvish word "Tulor," meaning "Sanctuary" or "Haven." The name was chosen by the first Elven settlers, led by Othorian Nel, who saw the city as a refuge and a beacon of Elven culture and wisdom amidst the harsh and untamed lands of Tiamat. The Elves considered this land sacred, as it was blessed with natural beauty and magical energies that they believed were gifts from Tiamat herself.

As Humans began to settle in Tulorian and establish their presence, the city became a shared sanctuary—a place where both Elves and Humans could coexist, despite the long history of conflict between them. The name "Tulorian" thus came to symbolize not just a haven for the Elves, but a shared destiny for all who lived within its borders.

**2. Description**

Tulorian is a city divided, both physically and culturally, between the Elves and Humans. It sits between three significant lakes—Dragon Lake, Nown Lake, and the Lake of Life—all of which are deeply connected to the city’s lore and the legend of Tiamat.

### **Dragon Lake**

Located to the south of Tulorian, Dragon Lake is a seething cauldron of heated water, symbolizing the raw power of Tiamat. According to legend, Dragon Lake was formed from the fiery breath of Tiamat, the great dragon deity, and it is said that the lake still retains a portion of her immense power. The waters of Dragon Lake are known for their alchemical properties and are often used to create strength potions. The heat of the lake is so intense that it never freezes, even in the coldest winters, and steam often rises from its surface, giving the surrounding area a mystical, almost otherworldly atmosphere.

### **Nown Lake**

To the north of Tulorian lies Nown Lake, a stark contrast to Dragon Lake. Nown Lake is frigid and clear, its icy waters believed to be imbued with the wisdom of Tiamat, as it represents her mind and intellect. Elven scholars and Human alchemists alike come to Nown Lake to collect its waters, which are said to enhance intelligence and mental clarity when used in potions. The lake's cold, calm demeanor is a reflection of the calculated and strategic nature of Tiamat’s thoughts, and its waters are often sought after by those seeking knowledge and insight.

### **Lake of Life**

Situated in the heart of Tulorian, between Dragon Lake and Nown Lake, is the Lake of Life. This warm, nurturing body of water is the lifeblood of Tulorian, both literally and figuratively. The Lake of Life is home to the **Tree of Eternity**, a massive tree that stands on an island at the lake’s center. The lake’s waters are said to have healing properties, making it a natural reservoir of health potions. The Elves believe that life itself on Tiamat began from the waters of this lake, and it is also where the fabled **White Egg Shard**—a remnant of Tiamat’s heart—is believed to reside, giving the lake its miraculous properties.

Historically, these three lakes were once connected, forming a vast, interconnected body of water that encircled Tulorian. However, over the centuries, particularly after **4643 A.T.**, the lakes have gradually receded and separated. This phenomenon has caused great concern among both the Elves and Humans. Each side blames the other for the diminishing water levels, accusing one another of overusing the lakes' resources to extend their lives and gain power. The shrinking of the Lake of Life, in particular, has become a source of tension, with both races fearing that the loss of these sacred waters could spell doom for their respective societies.

Due to the importance and sacred nature of these waters, it is **strictly illegal** for anyone to swim in or take water from any of the lakes without explicit permission from both Othorian Nel and the current Human King. Violators of this law face severe penalties, as both sides believe that unauthorized use of the lakes' waters could further accelerate their decline.

### **Dragonbreath Sea**

Beyond the lakes, to the south of Tulorian, lies the Dragonbreath Sea—a vast, tempestuous body of water that stretches from Kin to Kastof. The sea, named for the breath of Tiamat, is known for its fierce storms and treacherous waters. It is a wild, untamed sea that reflects the chaotic nature of Tiamat’s creation. The Dragonbreath Sea is a critical trade route, connecting various cities along the coast, but it is also feared by sailors for its unpredictable weather. Despite the dangers, it is said that one can travel from Kin to Kastof relatively easily when the seas are calm, though such times are rare.

**3. Location**

Tulorian is situated in the northeastern region of Tiamat, perched between the three lakes—Dragon Lake to the south, Nown Lake to the north, and the Lake of Life in the center. These lakes are crucial to the city, not just for their beauty, but because they serve as natural barriers and sources of sustenance. The waters from these lakes flow into the Dragonbreath Sea, a vital trade route that connects Tulorian with the rest of Tiamat and beyond.

The city’s strategic location between these lakes and the sea has made it a hub of commerce, diplomacy, and conflict throughout history:

- **1 A.T.**: Tulorian was founded by the Elves under the leadership of Othorian Nel. The city's location was chosen not just for its beauty, but for its strategic importance. The interconnected lakes provided a natural defense, a source of sustenance, and a sacred connection to Tiamat.
    
- **1630 A.T.**: The rapid spread of Humanity saw the founding of many new cities, including Chin, which was built dangerously close to Tulorian. The proximity of Chin to the Elven capital created immense political tension, eventually leading to its destruction in **1680 A.T.** by the Elves after the discovery of weapons and dark magic being produced there. This event marked the beginning of the Elven-Human War.
    
- **1800 A.T.**: After decades of conflict and the devastating Great Orcish War, Othorian Nel decided to allow Humans to share political power in Tiamat as a means to prevent further wars. This decision solidified Tulorian's role as the heart of Tiamat, where Elves and Humans would rule together. The lakes played a symbolic role in this unity, though their gradual separation reflected the underlying tensions between the two races.
    
- **4643 A.T.**: The Great Lake of Tiamat, which had once encircled the city, separated into the three lakes we know today—Dragon Lake, Nown Lake, and the Lake of Life. This event is still remembered as a turning point in Tulorian's history, symbolizing the growing divide between Elves and Humans.

**4. Special Interactions**

Tulorian is rich in tradition, religious significance, and magical interactions, with the lakes playing a central role:

- **The Festival of Radiant Dawn**: This grand event, held once every decade, is a city-wide celebration where both Elves and Humans honor their traditions. The Elves illuminate the House of Nel and Magic Citadel with enchanted lights, while Humans hold elaborate processions leading to the Temple of Tiamat. The festival is a rare time of unity, culminating in a ceremony at the Tree of Eternity, where leaders from both sides come together to bless the city.
    
- **The Silver Guard and the Knights of the Flame**: These elite forces are tasked with protecting Tulorian’s two halves. The Silver Guard, clad in enchanted silver armor, patrols Eldergrove, while the Knights of the Flame, the human equivalent, ensure the security of New Dawn. Both groups are fiercely loyal to their respective leaders and often find themselves at odds with one another, reflecting the broader tensions in the city.
    
- **The Council of Balance**: Tulorian is governed by this council, composed of equal parts Elven and Human representatives. They meet regularly in the House of Valar, a neutral building straddling the border of Eldergrove and New Dawn. Here, they discuss matters of state, trade, and law, always attempting to maintain the delicate balance between the two cultures.
    
- **The Tiamat Church**: Deeply integrated into Human politics, the Tiamat Church is more than a religious institution—it is the backbone of Human society in Tulorian. The church’s influence can be seen in every aspect of life in New Dawn, from laws to education. The Temple of Tiamat is the center of this power, where the High Priest oversees both spiritual and temporal matters, often clashing with Elven traditions and beliefs. The church teaches that Tiamat is the creator and protector of humanity, and it is the duty of all Humans to spread her teachings and ensure her will is done.
    
- **Lake Lore and Potions**: The lakes surrounding Tulorian have deep connections to the city’s magical practices. Dragon Lake’s waters are used to brew strength potions, while Nown Lake’s icy waters are essential for crafting intelligence potions. The Lake of Life’s shrinking size has become a source of tension, with both sides accusing each other of overuse. The lakes are often seen as the brain and brawn of Tiamat, representing the balance of wisdom, health, and power in the city. However, the decline of the water levels has led to a strict law forbidding the use of the lakes’ waters without permission from both Othorian Nel and the current Human King.

**5. Purpose to Lore**

Tulorian is the heart of Tiamat’s dual civilization, representing both the legacy of the Elves and the ambition of Humanity. It is the seat of power, where the most important decisions affecting the continent are made. Tulorian’s significance extends beyond its physical location; it is a symbol of the uneasy peace between two very different cultures.

The city was central during the Elven-Human War, and its current structure reflects the compromise that ended that conflict. Tulorian is where Elves and Humans coexist, but not without tension. The Church of Tiamat’s power in Human society often conflicts with the Elves' more nature-based, arcane traditions. The balance of power is fragile, and the city serves as both a beacon of hope for cooperation and a powder keg of potential conflict.

The lakes play a pivotal role in the lore of Tulorian, not just as geographical features, but as symbols of the city’s strengths and weaknesses. They are the sources of power, wisdom, and life, yet they also represent the divisions and tensions that run through the heart of Tulorian society. The shrinking water levels and the strict laws surrounding the use of the lakes' waters reflect the ongoing struggle between the Elves and Humans to maintain their influence and power.

**6. Other**

- **The House of Nel and the House of Rex**: These two grand buildings serve as the seats of power for the Elves and Humans, respectively. The House of Nel is a place of beauty and wisdom, where Elven leaders govern and study. The House of Rex, in contrast, is a fortress of stone and iron, symbolizing the strength and resilience of Humanity. Both houses are centers of their respective cultures and are constantly at the center of political maneuvering.
    
- **The Port Sulo and the Human Docks**: Tulorian’s position on the lakes and near the sea makes it a key player in trade and diplomacy. Port Sulo, the Elven harbor, is known for its elegance and efficiency, while the Human docks are bustling with activity and commerce. These ports are vital to the city’s economy and its connections with the rest of Tiamat.
    
- **The Tree of Eternity**: This ancient tree is a shared symbol for both Elves and Humans, though its meanings differ. For the Elves, it represents life and renewal, a reminder of their deep connection to the natural world. For the Humans, it is a symbol of Tiamat’s enduring presence, a holy site where they can feel closest to their deity. The Tree of Eternity stands at the center of the city, a constant reminder of the city’s dual heritage and the need for cooperation.
