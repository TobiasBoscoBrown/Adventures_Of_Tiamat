A Brief History of [[Lore of Tiamat]] by Hist Orey



Much is known about the great history of Tiamat as many of our ancestors

kept good records of what they have done. However it occurs to me that

looking at Tiamat from a glance hasn't been possible due to the vast

amount of information there is about us. That is why I've decided to set

about writing this book. Here we can look at Tiamat, get the main story

and points, and see how far we have come, all without spending hours of

time trying to learn every king's pet's name.



Very little is actually known about the origins of Tiamat 6000 years

ago. So many stories have arisen, however one main one seems to be the

consensus. As for things that happened B.T.(Before Tiamat) there is very

little to no information. I have done my best to put the pieces

together, although many things during this time are just stories passed

down by word of mouth and may be just that stories. Regardless, here it

goes.



B.T. is an era **Before Tiamat** fought The Old Gods. During this time the

universe and world were still in the midst of creation. Tiamat had

always existed, however while fighting Them in the ether, she and their

clash created the rest of the physical universe. Stars are fireballs

from Tiamat, planets are debris from her other breaths. Black Holes are

where Tiamat and The Old Gods collided. She and Them fought, but They

prevailed. Tiamat, injured and dying, clawed at Them and

dragged a piece of Them down to the world with her. Tiamat died.



10 B.T. A great tragedy happened upon the Imperial Kingdom, causing most

of the Elves to set sail to a new world. Othorian Nel was born as they

were leaving.



When Tiamat had died, The Ancient Elves watched Tiamat get defeated by

the Old Gods and fall to The World. [[Othorian Nel.pdf]] was 10 years old when this happened.

Her Fall created a place for the Elves to land their ships.



1 A.T. Tulorian was founded by the Elves.



214 A.T. The Battle of the Minds split the Elves into different ways of

thinking. While some Elves believed that they should grow, adapt, and

evolve, another sect of elves wanted to stick to their natural roots.

This caused a great migration of Elves to live a traditional life, while

the other half continued to advance society in Tulorian. This split

created the Wood and High Elves.



457 A.T. Dwarves arrive on Tiamat. The Elves and Dwarves did not get

along well, and they were given very little help adapting to the new

land. They stayed separated, and caused no big territorial issues

considering that the continent had not yet been very colonized.



481 KneeStone Mines were founded.



946 A.T. Orcs arrive on Tiamat. They were very unkind and unwelcome in

general by both Elves and Dwarves. This is where base territorial

battles began, although it was more of battles here and there if they

ever crossed paths and not necessarily enough forces for it to be a war.

A blight began to spread through the land.



958 A.T. Hell was founded.



989 A.T. The Blight was spreading through the land and ruining it

severely. However it ended abruptly. This began the Good Era of Peace.



1063 A.T. Humans arrived to Tiamat. They were welcomed by the Elves and

Dwarves. Orcs were not kind to the outsiders. Humans had escaped near

elimination due to the disasters happening on their continent, and

thought of Tiamat as their savior. They created the religion of Tiamat.

They began to spread their religion all over Tiamat, forcefully

somtimes. They reproduced quickly. This caused the Great Spread of

Humanity.



1080 A.T. Cardious was founded.



1088 A.T. Harven was founded.



1104 A.T. Kubi was founded.



1105 A.T. Nodo was founded.



1216 A.T. Helne was founded.



1324 A.T. Ankor was founded.



1414 A.T. Kastof was founded.



1548 A.T. Nether was founded.



1630 A.T. Chin was founded. This series of rapid spreading known as the

Great Spread of Humanity was beginning to cause concern to the other

Races of Tiamat. Chin was extremely close to Tulorian and the Elves took

it as an apparent militant placement in their territory. Political

tensions began to rapidly rise, and there was little to stop racism from

spreading.



1679 A.T. Jarnath was born.


1680 A.T. Chin was destroyed by the Elves after it was discovered that

weapons and dark magic was being created there. This began the Elven

Human War.



1699 A.T. Jarnath fought Othorian Nel for the rights of Tiamat to the

humans. Jarnath was beaten. This was ultimately the Human's final stand

against the Elves. The Elven Human war ended.



1700 A.T. Othorian Nel took command with his forces against all Human

cities and became the First King of Tiamat. He tried to hold down all of

Humanity, weaken them, and continue to fight any remnants of the Human

Army for Tiamat.



1730 A.T. [[Jarnath.pdf]] had a rematch with Othorian Nel. Jarnath lost again,

and Othorian decided that he would have to shut down Jarnath by

destroying Nether.



1735 A.T. The Orcs were enraged at how they were treated, and saw an

opportunity to take over Tiamat while the Elves and Humans were weakened

by the war. Hellbringer the 5th started the Great Orcish War. The Humans

and Elves fought back seperately against the Orcs brutality while still

fighting amongst themselves. Meanwhile The Blight had begun to spread

again.



1800 A.T. Tiamat was being torn apart by the Great Orcish War. The

population fell in half. Eventually the Humans and Elves joined forces

in order to defeat the common enemy. With the power of the Humans and

Elves combined, they defeated the Orcs. Othorian Nel decided letting the

Humans have equal political power in Tiamat would prevent any more wars

between Elves and Humans. King Charlie the 1st became the first Human

King of Tiamat alongside King Othorian. The Hellbringers were pushed

back against the Spinal Mountains and the Quielent forest, and the

family became known as the Grudge. The city of Hell changed its' name to

Grudge.



2120 A.T. Elves and Humans were struggling to rebuild due to the war,

and decided to put on heavy sanctions onto Grudge. The Orcs were

horribly mistreated.



2430 A.T. The Grudge family after growing their numbers finally began

their rebellion.



2467 A.T. Gondor was founded.



2516 A.T. The Great Orc Rebellion was shut down, however they had now

gained respect from Tiamat, and given a little more room and rights.

This began the Great Long Era of Peace.



2549 A.T. Dangar was founded.



2654 A.T. The Age of Exploration began. There were stories of Great

Treasure. Pirates and Explorers traveled throughout the seas looking for

adventure.



3239 A.T. The Great Goat Incident.



3600 A.T. Hell Pass was created.



3834 A.T. Chin was rebuilt as Kin.



4239 A.T. Some Orcs began to do some raids onto nearby towns.



4401 A.T. Puke was founded.



4643 A.T. The Great Lake of Tiamat was separated into 3 lakes; Nown

Lake, Life Lake, and Dragon Lake.



4790 A.T. Due to the difficulty of getting through Hell Pass, New Lorian

was just founded.



5121 A.T. New Lorian is Raided so often that it is renamed Hell's

Barrow.



5122 A.T. Puke is destroyed.



5256 A.T. Population is at an all time high. Most races are living

relatively peacefully together. There are rising political tensions,

however, society is very stable and established except for Puke and

Hell's Barrow.



5938 A.T. Another Blight has began to appear.



6000 A.T. Present Year. Hell's Barrow has been destroyed.



6000 A.T. Hell's Barrow becomes renewed and named Dank Docs.



While there is still plenty of gaps that need to be filled in, this is a

basic guide for the history of Tiamat. I hope you enjoyed and learned

something.
